You can insert the text just like typing here

However, if you want to add the heading in the document we need to at with

# Heading (Make sure you add space after \#)

## Smaller header can also be added

You can do till header 6

If you want to add the italics we need to words between (*word*) and for bold font we need (**word**).

We can also use (_word_) for italics and (__word__) for bold.

**NoTICE, FOR ADDING SPACE BETWEEN YOU LINE YOU NEED TO HIT ENTER KEY TWO TIME**

Now if you was to add subscript such as 3^rd^ Oct, 2023

For Subscript we need (H~2~O) but for strikethrough we need two ~~Hello~~.

For the equation if you write equation $x=mx+C$ and for equation in new line $$X^2 + Y^2 = r^2$$ where $$r ~ \beta$$

Now if you want to add link, download [R studio](www.google.com)

of let add images ![Rstudio](./images.png){width=10%}

Now let we need to add the list of items.

1.  List one

    -   Sublist (not order)
        * thrid order

    a.  List with name

2.  Number 2

Imaging you want to add table

| First Header | Second Header |
|--------------|---------------|
| Content Cell | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  |

There is better way to do this.

Let start adding the R codes now

```{r name of chuck, include=T, echo=TRUE,warning=T}
name = "Chandan Pandey"
x <- paste("My names is",name,sep=" ")
print(x)
```

## using Inline command

My name is `r name`.
